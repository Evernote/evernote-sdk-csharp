Evernote SDK for C#
========================================

Evernote API version 1.25

Overview
--------
This SDK contains wrapper code used to call the Evernote Cloud API from C# applications.

The SDK also contains three sample solutions. The solution in sample/client demonstrates the basic use of the SDK in a .NET application like you might build for the Windows desktop. The solution in sample/wp7 demonstrates the basic use of the SDK in a Windows Phone 7 Silverlight application. The solution in sample/win8 demonstrates the basic use of the SDK in a Windows 8 XAML/C# Store App.

Prerequisites
-------------
In order to use the code in this SDK, you need to obtain an API key from http://dev.evernote.com/documentation/cloud. You'll also find full API documentation on that page.

In order to run the sample code, you need a user account on the sandbox service where you will do your development. Sign up for an account at https://sandbox.evernote.com/Registration.action 

In order to run the client client sample code, you need a developer token. Get one at https://sandbox.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action

For an example on how to use OAuth to authorize your C# website to access a user's notebook, see https://github.com/shaunmccarthy/AsyncOAuth.Evernote.Simple
